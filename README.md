Everything
==========

Everything I've made so far.

CFS(): Factors a number and give you the difference/sum of the factors.

Therom(): Does pythagorean theorem for you, adds and finds.

GCF(arg1, arg2): Returns the GCF of two numbers.

pointslope(): #(x1, y1) + (slope or coord pair) to y=mx+b (and standard) format

GCFN(arg1, arg2): See GCF, same thing, made for IOPC()

IOPC(): Takes two numbers, multiplies them, then divides their product by a number, for you.

fracfloat(frac): Converts fractions to floats

Distance(): Gets the distance and midpoint of two coord pairs.

count(sequence, item): Counts the number of times item occurs in sequence.

MostNums(List): Returns the number that occurs most often in the list.

MMMR(List): Return a dictonary of the Mean, Median, Mode and Range of a List of ints

MMMRX(List, desired, x): Finds the number needed to make the desired average out of a list of numbers.

StandardConverter(): Converts x+y=b to y=mx+b
